## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

2. Build and run the application using Maven:

The application will start on http://localhost:8080.

## API Endpoints

### Get Numbers

- **URL**: `/api/numbers`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: A stream of `Number` objects emitted every second, limited to 10 numbers.

## Testing the API

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [curl](https://curl.se/), or your web browser to interact with the API.

For example, to test the `GET /api/numbers` endpoint using curl, execute the following command:

curl http://localhost:8080/api/numbers


You should see a stream of numbers being emitted, one per second, up to 10 numbers.
